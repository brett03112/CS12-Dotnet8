Razor Page for Displaying Customer Orders

This is a Razor page in an ASP.NET Core web application, specifically designed to 
display a customer's orders. Here's a breakdown:

--The page uses a CustomerOrdersModel as its model, which is expected to contain customer data.

--The page sets a title and displays it as a heading (<h1>...</h1>).

--If the customer data is not null, the page displays the customer's company name and a table of their orders, including order ID and date.
    Key Components:

--@page: Indicates this is a Razor page.

--@model CustomerOrdersModel: Specifies the page's model.

--@if (Model.Customer is not null): Conditional statement to check if customer data is available.

--ForEach (Order o in Model.Customer.Orders): Loops through the customer's orders and displays 
    the order ID and date for each one in a table row.
